#  Simplilearn - (EDA) - Data Science Master Program Assignment
### Automobile Data Exploration (1,2,3)- Simplilearn - (EDA) - Explore historical dataset of car production and recognize the irregulaties 
#### Problem statement:
Mtcars, an automobile company in Chambersburg, United States, has recorded the production of its cars within a dataset. The company is coming up with a new model based on the feedback given by its customers. It has to explore the current dataset to derive further insights from it.It has planned to rework on optimizing the horsepower of its cars as most of the customersâ€™ feedback was centered around horsepower. However, while developing an ML model with respect to horsepower, the efficiency of the model was compromised. Irregularity might be one of the causes.
#### Objective: 1. Import the dataset, explore for dimensionality, and type and average value of the horsepower across all the cars. Also, identify a few of mostly correlated features, which would help
#### Objective:2. Identify how efficiency of car was effected by hp changes
#### Objective:3. Check for missing values and outliers within the horsepower column and remove them
### SFO Public Department - Salary Analysis of Employee and Rationalize Employee Cost to save payroll budget
#### DESCRIPTION SFO Public Department, referred to as SFO, has captured the salary data of all its employees for the years 2011-2014. Now in 2018, the organization is facing some financial crisis. As a first step, HR wants to rationalize employee cost to save payroll budget. You have to perform data manipulation and answer the questions below:
#### Objective: 1.How much total salary cost has increased from year 2011 to 2014?
#### Objective:2. Who was the top-earning employee across all the years? Objective: Perform data manipulation and visualization techniques.
### Boston Homes -  House price and feature prediction
#### DESCRIPTION:A real estate company wants to build homes at different locations in Boston. They have data for historical prices but have not decided the actual prices yet. They want to fix such a price for the homes that are affordable to the general public. 
####  Objective: 1. Import the Boston data from scikit-learn and read the description using DESCR.
#### Objective: 2. Analyze the data and predict the approximate prices for the houses. 
#### Objective: 3. cross-reference results using regularization techniques. 
#### Objective: 4. Build a predictive model using Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet
#### Objective: 5. Compare the models on the basis of accuracy.
