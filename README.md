### Automobile Data Exploration (1,2,3)- Simplilearn - (EDA)
#### Problem statement:
Mtcars, an automobile company in Chambersburg, United States, has recorded the production of its cars within a dataset. The company is coming up with a new model based on the feedback given by its customers. It has to explore the current dataset to derive further insights from it.It has planned to rework on optimizing the horsepower of its cars as most of the customersâ€™ feedback was centered around horsepower. However, while developing an ML model with respect to horsepower, the efficiency of the model was compromised. Irregularity might be one of the causes.

#### Objective: 1. Import the dataset, explore for dimensionality, and type and average value of the horsepower across all the cars. Also, identify a few of mostly correlated features, which would help
#### Objective:2. Identify how efficiency of car was effected by hp changes
#### Objective:3. Check for missing values and outliers within the horsepower column and remove them
